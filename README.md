## 2.How to use it?
You can see all method on the JavaDoc.

I will tell you some simple use way here.

### 2.1. How to construction a GPIOControl object?

 GPIOControl control = new GPIOControl(100);`
 
You can construction a GPIOControl object like this.

There have a args, it's call "gpioNum", please fill out your GPIO index at here.

### 2.2. How to export my pin?
`
 control.export();`

It can export your pin.

If your pin is exporting, it will break.

### 2.3. How to set mode?
`
